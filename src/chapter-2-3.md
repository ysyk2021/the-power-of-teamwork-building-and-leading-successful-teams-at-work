Identifying Your Preferred Role in a Team

* **Consider Skill Alignment**: Evaluate how your skills, strengths, and expertise align with different team roles. Determine where you can make the greatest impact and contribute most effectively.

Assessing Your Communication Style

Seeking Feedback

* **Be Open to Constructive Criticism**: Embrace constructive criticism as an opportunity for growth. Actively listen, reflect on the feedback received, and consider how you can apply it to enhance your teamwork approach.

Professional Development Opportunities
